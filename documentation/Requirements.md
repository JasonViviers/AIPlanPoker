**Product Vision & Description**  
We aim to deliver a user‑friendly estimation platform that empowers remote‑first Scrum teams to collaborate efficiently on sprint planning. By combining live voting, flexible asynchronous participation, and intelligent estimation insights, the tool will help teams reach consensus faster, improve estimate accuracy, and keep distributed members fully engaged—ultimately driving more predictable delivery and higher team alignment.

**Business Requirements**

1. **Seamless Real‑Time Collaboration**  
   - All participants in a live session must see vote submissions instantly, preserving the flow of discussion and minimizing interruptions.

2. **Flexible Asynchronous Estimation**  
   - Team members who cannot attend the live meeting must be able to cast their estimates within a defined window (e.g., 24 hours) and have those votes automatically integrated into the session results.

3. **Intelligent Estimation Assistance**  
   - Provide each user story with a suggested estimate derived from past data and patterns, serving as a discussion baseline and improving overall accuracy.

4. **Role‑Based Session Control**  
   - Only designated facilitators (e.g., Scrum Masters) can create, manage, and close estimation sessions, ensuring proper governance of the planning process.

5. **Persistent Session Records**  
   - Maintain a durable record of each session—stories, votes, and suggestions—that can be exported or reviewed later for retrospectives and audit purposes.

6. **High Adoption & Usability**  
   - The tool must onboard new users within minutes, offering an intuitive interface that requires minimal training and encourages widespread adoption across teams.

7. **Accurate Outcome Reporting**  
   - Generate clear, shareable summaries (e.g., CSV export) of session outcomes—estimated values, participant engagement, and AI‑baseline comparisons—to support stakeholder visibility.

8. **Scalable for Distributed Teams**  
   - Support growing team sizes and multiple concurrent sessions without degrading the user experience, ensuring the platform remains reliable as the organization expands.

9. **Actionable Insights for Continuous Improvement**  
   - Track basic estimation metrics (e.g., variance between initial AI suggestion and final team consensus) to help teams identify patterns and refine their planning practices over time.
